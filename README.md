# Independent-Study
A collection of files/notes I have prepared based on studies I have carried out independently of courses and projects.

Sources:
For the many particle physics notes, I have extensively consulted the books "Many Particle Physics"- Gerald Mahan and "Introduction to Many-Body Physics"- Piers Coleman.
